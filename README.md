# Starting-out
beginning activities -- &amp; 'newbie' observations

General engineering observation:  
Operational testing of any and all projects - whether software, hardware, or any combination - needs to be performed by persons who have NOT participated in the development of the project!!!

It's OK for the ppl who do the development to do as much (or little) testing as they want to.  But that testing is not at all sufficient for any project to be released for use by ppl not directly involved in that project.   

MUCH grief in the world can thus be avoided.  :)
